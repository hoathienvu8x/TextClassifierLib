# Sentiment Analysis with CountVectorizer

## Project Goals
1. To implement the ADT CountVectorizer
 * Knowing only the usage of CV, implement an efficient data structure
 * Incorporate a common use application for the data structure
2. To further familiarize myself with TDD
 * And obey the testing goat...
3. To write industry-quality code
 * Proper syntax, best practices, efficient

 ### Note on Project Goals:
 The CountVectorizer is a data structure that is not limited to the functionality of what I built.
 If my only goal were to do simple sentiment analysis, a more efficient data structure could have been
 built.

## Project Overview:
##### What is a CountVectorizer?
A CountVectorizer is an ADT from the popular ML library Scikit Learn.  In their words, a CountVectorizer:

"Converts a collection of text documents to a matrix of token counts"
